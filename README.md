# xssSick

xssSick is a Python script for identifying potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It reads URLs from a file, modifies each URL's parameters with a gibberish value containing brackets and signs, and searches the response for reflections and matches. Found URLs are saved to an output file.

## Features

- Reads URLs from a file.
- Modifies each URL's parameters with a specific test value containing brackets and signs.
- Sends HTTP requests to the modified URLs.
- Searches the response source code for specific words and signs that indicate XSS possibilities.
- Saves the URLs where matches are found to an output file.
- Displays output in the terminal: `blue` for processed URLs, `red` for unreachable URLs, and `green` for matches (XSS) found.
- Experimental (must be enabled manually): Detects DOM XSS (uncomment `dom_possible` function definition and calls).
